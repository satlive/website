We are inviting applications for a PhD studentship in Computer Science at the University of Liverpool, starting **1 October 2026** (apply by **15 January 2026**).

The studentship is part of the [**EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Digital and Automated Materials Chemistry**](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/doctoral-training/digital-and-automated-materials-chemistry), offering cohort-based training and access to a large interdisciplinary community working on digital and automated methods for materials discovery.

The project develops **logic-based constrained sampling** methods (SAT/SMT-style encodings, approximate uniform sampling) to generate chemically sensible, unbiased starting structures for **crystal structure prediction (CSP)** workflows.

The project will focus on:

- logical encodings of chemistry constraints
- SAT-based sampling to generate structures
- integrating samplers into CSP workflows
- comparing with generative AI and heuristic approaches

This is a **CS-heavy project** at the chemistry/CS interface. A background in SAT/SMT, formal methods, or related areas is highly relevant; **no prior chemistry knowledge is required**.
