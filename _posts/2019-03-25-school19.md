Satisfiability (SAT), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), and Automated
Reasoning (AR) continue to make rapid advances and find novel uses in a wide
variety of applications, both in computer science and beyond. The SAT/SMT/AR
Summer School aims to bring a select group of students up to speed quickly in
this exciting research area. The school continues the successful line of
Summer Schools that ran from 2011 to 2015 as SAT/SMT Summer Schools and added
AR in 2016.

The SAT/SMT/AR summer school will precede [SAT
2019](http://sat2019.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) and [SMT
2019](http://smt2019.galois.com/) taking place on July 3-6, 2019 at the
Instituto Superior Técnico (IST/UL), University of Lisbon, Portugal.
