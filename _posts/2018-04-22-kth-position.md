The Theory Group at KTH Royal Institute of Technology is looking for 
a PhD student in SAT solving.

The TCS Group at KTH Royal Institute of Technology invites applications for a PhD position in CS focusing on algorithms for solving the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) very efficiently for large classes of instances, and on analyzing and understanding such algorithms. To receive full consideration your application should be submitted via http://www.csc.kth.se/~jakobn/openings/J-2018-0940-Eng.php by the deadline May 15, 2018, but candidates will be reviewed continuously and early applications are encouraged.

 

This is a position within the [Wallenberg Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Systems and Software Program WASP](http://wasp-sweden.org/), Sweden's largest ever individual research program and a major national initiative for strategically motivated basic research, education and faculty recruitment. The PhD student will be part of the WASP AI-Math Graduate School, providing a valuable network with other researchers within WASP and presenting unique opportunities for students who are dedicated to achieving international research excellence with industrial relevance.

 

This is a four-year full-time employed position, but PhD positions usually (though not necessarily) include 20% teaching, in which case they are prolonged for one more year. The successful candidate is expected to start at the latest in August-September 2018, although this is to some extent negotiable. The position is fully funded and comes with a competitive salary.

 

See [the full announcement](http://www.csc.kth.se/~jakobn/openings/J-2018-0940-Eng.php) with more information and instructions how to apply. Informal enquiries are welcome and may be sent to jakobn@kth.se .
