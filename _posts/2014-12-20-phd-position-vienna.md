There is an opening for a funded PhD position in Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF) solving at the Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria. 

The PhD student will join Stefan Szeider's research group to develop and implement new methods for leveraging variable independence in QBF solvers, as part of a new research project funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF). Applicants are expected to have solid programming skills and a strong interest in theory. A background in QBF or SAT solving is of advantage.

The position is for a duration of three years (the expected duration for completing the PhD). The successful applicant is expected to start in 2015. The salary is according to standard FWF contracts for PhD candidates (approx. EUR 27,500 gross, p.a.), which allows for a convenient living in Vienna close to the city center.

The application should include the candidate's CV, an abstract of their diploma/masters thesis, a short motivation letter, and two letters of recommendation (all five items in a single pdf file). The application should also mention possible starting dates and should be sent to qbf@kr.tuwien.ac.at by February 15, 2015.
