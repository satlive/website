<p>Offered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A full time, temporary appointment for a period of 6 months;</li>
  <li>Starting date: from September 2014 but possibly later (the postdoc has to take place between September 2014 and April 2015);</li>

</ul>

<p>This postdoc deals with the practical application of tractability results to enhance the efficiency of SAT solvers.
Until now, tractable classes have usually been studied from a purely theoretical point of view, their practical use
for solving general instances have not received much attention. For example, the current SAT solvers do not perform
any tractability analysis before or during the resolution of a given instance.</p>

<p>Our goal in this work is to bridge the gap between theory and practice by effectively exploiting the
tractability/intractability results to design the next generation of SAT solvers. The different results obtained in
the ANR project TUPLES ‚ÄúTractability for Understanding and Pushing forward the Limits of Efficient Solvers‚Äù will
give us several possible research issues for the design of both strong simplification techniques (pre-processing) and
efficient solvers.
The consortium has a great experience in the development of SAT solvers. The CRIL team host and maintain several
solvers, which have won awards in the different SAT competitions.</p>

<p>Applications should include the following materials:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a motivation letter</li>
  <li>a detailed CV (with publications)</li>
  <li>two references</li>
</ul>

<p>Please apply as soon as possible. A first selection will be done during the last week of July 2014. Later applications
will be considered if no applicant has been selected at this date.</p>

<p>The position is located at CRIL, University of Artois, Lens (France).</p>
