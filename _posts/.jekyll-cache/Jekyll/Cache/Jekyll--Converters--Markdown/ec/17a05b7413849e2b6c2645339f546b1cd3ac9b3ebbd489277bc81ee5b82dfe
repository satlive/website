I"w<p>The Theory Group at KTH Royal Institute of Technology invites applications for postdoctoral positions in SAT solving.</p>

<p>The postdoctoral researchers will be working in the research group of <a href="http://www.csc.kth.se/~jakobn">Jakob Nordstrom</a>. Much of the activities of this research group revolve around the themes of proof complexity and SAT solving. On the practical side, some interesting problems are to gain a better understanding of the performance of current state-of-the-art SAT solvers — in particular, solvers using conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) — and to explore techniques that would go beyond CDCL, such as approaches based on algebraic or geometric reasoning.</p>

<p>These are full-time employed positions for one year with a possible one-year extension. The expected start date is August-September 2016, although this is to some extent negotiable.</p>

<p>The application deadline is January 24, 2016. More information and instructions how to apply can be found at http://www.csc.kth.se/~jakobn/openings/D-2015-0823-Eng.php . Informal enquiries are welcome and may be sent to Jakob Nordstrom.</p>
