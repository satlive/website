<p><em>For the past 40 years computer scientists generally believed that NP- complete problems are intractable. In particular, Boolean satisfiability (SAT), as a  paradigmatic NP-complete problem, has been considered to be intractable. Over the  past 20 years, however, there has been a quiet, but dramatic, revolution, and very  large SAT instances are now being solved routinely as part of software and hardware design.  In this talk I will review this amazing development and show that we can le- verage SAT solving to accomplish other Boolean reasoning tasks. Counting the the  number of satisfying truth assignments of a given Boolean formula or sampling such  assignments uniformly at random are fundamental computational problems in com- puter science with numerous applications. While the theory of these problems has  been thoroughly investigated in the 1980s, approximation algorithms developed by  theoreticians do not scale up to industrial-sized instances. Algorithms used by the  industry offer better scalability, but give up certain correctness guarantees to achieve  scalability. We describe a novel approach, based on universal hashing and Satisfiabi- lity Modulo Theory, that scales to formulas with hundreds of thousands of variable  without giving up correctness guarantees.</em></p>
