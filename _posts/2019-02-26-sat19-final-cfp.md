-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The International Conference on Theory and Applications of
Satisfiability Testing (SAT) is the premier annual meeting for
researchers focusing on the theory and applications of the
propositional satisfiability problem, broadly construed. In addition
to plain propositional satisfiability, it also includes Boolean
optimization (such as MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints),
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT), and Constraint Programming (CP) for problems with clear
connections to Boolean-level reasoning.

Many hard combinatorial problems can be tackled using SAT-based
techniques including problems that arise in Formal Verification,
Artificial Intelligence, Operations Research, Computational Biology,
Cryptography, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Mathematics, etc. Indeed,
the theoretical and practical advances in SAT research over the past
twenty years have contributed to making SAT technology an
indispensable tool in a variety of domains.

SAT 2019 aims to further advance the field by soliciting original
theoretical and practical contributions in these areas with a clear
connection to satisfiability. Specifically, SAT 2019 invites
scientific contributions addressing different aspects of SAT
interpreted in a broad sense, including (but not restricted to)
theoretical advances (such as exact algorithms, proof complexity, and
other complexity issues), practical search algorithms, knowledge
compilation, implementation-level details of SAT solvers and SAT-based
systems, problem encodings and reformulations, applications (including
both novel application domains and improvements to existing
approaches), as well as case studies and reports on findings based on
rigorous experimentation.

## Scope

SAT 2019 welcomes scientific contributions addressing different
aspects of the satisfiability problem, interpreted in a broad sense.
Domains include MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints, Quantified
Boolean Formulae (QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), as well
as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). Topics include, but are not
restricted to:

* Theoretical advances (including algorithms, proof complexity, parameterized complexity, and other complexity issues);
* Practical search algorithms;
* Knowledge compilation;
* Implementation-level details of SAT solving tools and SAT-based systems;
* Problem encodings and reformulations;
* Applications (including both novel applications domains and improvements to existing approaches);
* Case studies and reports on insightful findings based on rigorous experimentation.

## Out Of Scope

Papers claiming to resolve a major long-standing open theoretical
question in Mathematics or Computer Science (such as those for which a
Millennium Prize is offered), are outside the scope of the conference
because there is insufficient time in the schedule to referee such
papers; instead, such papers should be submitted to an appropriate
technical journal.

## Paper Categories

Submissions to SAT 2019 are solicited in three paper categories,
describing original contributions.

* Long papers (9 to 15 pages, excluding references)
* Short papers (up to 8 pages, excluding references)
* Tool papers (up to 6 pages, excluding references)

Long and short papers should contain original research, with
sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the
contribution. For papers reporting experimental results, authors are
strongly encouraged to make their data and implementations available
with their submission. Submissions reporting on case studies are also
encouraged, and should describe details, weaknesses, and strengths in
sufficient depth. Long and short papers will be evaluated with the
same quality standards, and are expected to contain a similar
contribution per page ratio.

The authors should choose between a long or a short paper depending on
the space they need to fully describe their contribution. The
classification between long and short papers is mainly a way to
balance the workload of the reviewing process among PC members. It
also impacts the duration of the presentation of the work during the
conference. It is the responsibility of the authors to make sure that
their paper is self-contained in the chosen limit of pages. There will
be no requalification of the submissions by the PC.

Tool papers must obey to a specific content criteria. A tool paper
should describe the implemented tool and its novel features. Here
“tools” are interpreted in a broad sense, including descriptions of
implemented solvers, preprocessors, etc., as well as systems that
exploit SAT solvers or their extensions for use in interesting problem
domains. A demonstration is expected to accompany a tool presentation.
Papers describing tools that have already been presented previously
are expected to contain significant and clear enhancements to the
tool.

## Submissions

Submissions should not be under review elsewhere nor be submitted
elsewhere while under review for SAT 2019, and should not consist of
previously published material.

Submissions not consistent with the above guidelines may be returned
without review.

Besides the paper itself, authors may submit a supplement consisting
of one file in the format of a gzipped tarball (.tar.gz or .tgz) or a
gzipped file (.gz) or a zip archive (.zip). Authors are encouraged to
submit a supplement when it will help reviewers evaluate the paper.
Supplements will be treated with the same degree of confidentiality as
the paper itself. For example, the supplement might contain detailed
proofs, examples, software, detailed experimental data, or other
material related to the submission. Individual reviewers may or may
not consult the supplementary material; the paper itself should be
self-contained.

All papers submissions are done exclusively via EasyChair in
Springer’s [LaTeX llncs2e
style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

One author of each accepted paper is expected to present it at the
conference.

## Deadlines

* March 1, 2019 - Abstract submission
* March 8, 2019 - Paper submission

## Proceedings

All accepted papers are expected to be published in the proceedings of
the conference, which will be published within the Springer LNCS
series.

## Best Paper Awards

Long and short papers may be considered for a best paper award. If the
main author is a student, both in terms of work and writing, the paper
may be considered for a best student paper award. Use the supplement
to your submission to state (in a brief cover letter) if the paper
qualifies as a student paper. Both the best paper award and the best
student paper award are sponsored by Springer.

The SAT association will provide partial travel support to students
with accepted papers to attend SAT 2018.
