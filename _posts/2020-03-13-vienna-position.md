The Algorithms & Complexity group at TU Wien invites applications for a PhD position in computer science focused on QBF solving.

The PhD student will work with Friedrich Slivovsky and Stefan Szeider on the project "Learning to Solve Quantified Boolean Formulas" funded by the Vienna Science Fund (WWTF), which aims to provide a new perspective on QBF solvers in terms of strategy learning.

This is a three-year full-time employed position, with May 2020 as the earliest possible starting date. The position is fully funded and comes with a competitive salary (approx. EUR 52,000.00 gross, p.a.).

Applicants need to have or be close to obtaining a MSc degree or a 4-year BSc degree in computer science or mathematics. They are expected to have a strong background in an area of computational logic, solid programming skills (preferably in C/C++), and a very good command of English.

The application **deadline** is **April 10th, 2020** at midnight local time.
