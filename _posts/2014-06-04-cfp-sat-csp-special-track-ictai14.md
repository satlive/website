                     Special Track on SAT and CSP

                                        at the

    26th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (IEEE ICTAI’14)
                        http://ictai2014.cs.ucy.ac.cy/
                November 10-12 2014, Limassol, Chyprus


Constraint Solving Programming (CSP) and SAT-related technologies are
major related topics of research and application in A.I., opening up
new perspectives
about effective A.I. application domains.

Over the years, the ICTAI conference has become a major forum for the
CSP and SAT
research communities for presenting new high-quality results (see the
special track program in 2013:
http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/ICTAI-SAT-CSP-Track/ICTAI-Schedule.htm )
The second edition of the special track is intended to further develop
the role of ICTAI in this respect.

## Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* CSP methodologies and tools
* Constraint networks
* Global constraints
* CSP and SAT Solvers
* Applications of CSP and SAT-based technologies
* Heuristic, complete and hybrid search techniques
* Heuristics for SAT and CSP
* SAT modulo theories
* AI techniques based on SAT and CSP
* Core, MUC and MUS extraction
* MAX-SAT, MAX-CSP
* Soft/Hard Constraints
* Weighted CSP and SAT
* Constraint optimization

Papers must be submitted in pdf only through the Easychair special
track submission
page (NOT through the general ICTAI Easychair conference page).  See submission
instructions in  http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/ICTAI14-SAT-CSP-Track/#submit

All papers will be reviewed by at least two members of the program committee.
Papers must report high-quality original work, be unpublished and not submitted
elsewhere during the whole ICTAI review process.

Each accepted paper must be presented by one of the authors and
accompanied by at
least one full ICTAI 2014 registration fee payment, to guarantee
publication in the
proceedings.

## Proceedings and Special Journal Issue

All papers accepted in the CSP and SAT technologies special track will
be included in
the ICTAI 2014 main proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society.
Extended versions of the best papers will be invited for publication in a
special issue of an International Journal after an additional round of reviews.

## Important Dates
