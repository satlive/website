During the winter 2025/26,  we are running a course "Proof Complexity as a Computational Lens" in Copenhagen and Lund. This is a course with a strongly theoretical focus, but we are mainly covering the part of proof complexity that can also be used to analyze SAT solvers, Gröbner basis algorithms, 0-1 linear programming solvers, and other combinatorial solving algorithms.

The lectures are being streamed on Zoom and recordings are posted on the [MIAO Research YouTube channel youtube.com/@MIAOresearch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ_jdOcEi5wYXqkziHFs8AMLSlmmnrzOH). More information about course schedule and topics can be found on [the course webpage](https://jakobnordstrom.se/teaching/proofcplx25/).
