SUMMARY OF CALL FOR PAPERS

(Please note that this is just a summary --- see [the full call](https://satisfiability.org/SAT26/pages/cfp.html) with all the details.)

SAT 2026 will take place **20-23 July, 2026** in **Lisbon, Portugal** at ISCTE, as part of [FLoC 2026](https://www.floc2026.org/).

### Scope

SAT 2026 is the 29th edition of the International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing. The scope of SAT 2026 includes all aspects of the theory and applications of propositional satisfiability, broadly construed. This includes Boolean optimization, such as MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints, Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), model counting, and Constraint Programming (CP), and integer linear programming (ILP) for problems with clear connections to Boolean-level reasoning.

Topics of interest for the SAT 2026 conference include (but are not limited to):

- Theoretical advances (including algorithms, proof complexity, parameterized complexity, and other complexity issues)
- Practical search algorithms
- Knowledge compilation
- Implementation-level details of SAT solving tools and SAT-based systems
- Problem encodings and reformulations
- Applications (including both novel applications domains and improvements to existing approaches)
- Case studies and reports on insightful findings based on rigorous experimentation

### Paper Categories

Submissions to SAT 2026 are invited in the following three categories:

- Long papers (9 to 15 pages, excluding references and appendices)
- Short papers (up to 8 pages, excluding references and appendices)
- Tool papers (up to 8 pages, excluding references and appendices)

### Submission

Submissions should not be under review elsewhere nor be submitted elsewhere while under review for SAT 2026, and should not consist of previously published material. Submissions not consistent with these guidelines may be returned without review.

### Important Dates

- Paper Submission: 27 February, 2026 (AoE)
- Rebuttal: 13-17 April, 2026
- Author Notification: 30 April, 2026
- Camera-ready Version: 14 May, 2026
- Conference: 20-23 July, 2026

### Proceedings

Accepted papers will be published as proceedings of the conference in the [Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs)](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/) as a free, open, electronic archive with access to all. Authors will retain full rights over their work. The accepted papers will be published under a [CC-BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0).
